# D(H)eat DoS Attack POC (CVE-2002-20001)
POC for Testing the Existence of D(HE)at DOS Attack for (CVE-2002-20001)


# Usage
command: python3 dheat_dos_attack_poc.py <IP_Address> <Port_Number>

<IP_Address>: Replace with the actual IP address or hostname of the SSH server you have permission to test.

<Port_Number>: Target Port number running SSH services.

Steps to execute:
To install Python 3 on Ubuntu, Kali, etc the basic command is:

$ sudo apt update

$ sudo apt install python3

Download & Changing file Permission:

$ git clone https://github.com/itmaniac/dheat_dos_attack_poc.git

$ cd dheat_dos_attack_poc

$ chmod +x dheat_dos_attack_poc.py

D(HE)at DOS Attack POC Test:

$ python3 dheat_dos_attack_poc.py 22 10.0.0.1

# Successful Execution Results:
Attempting to establish 50 connections to 10.0.0.1:22...

--- Test Results ---

Target: 10.0.0.1:22

Total connection attempts: 50

Successful connections: 50

Failed connections: 0

Total duration: 0.025 seconds

Connection rate: 1981.66 connections/sec

Warning: Connection rate is still high (greater than 20.0 conns/sec). Potentially vulnerable to DHEat DoS.
Remember: If 'PerSourceMaxStartups 1' is set on the server, this might be a false positive,
as the server is protected from a single source, even if it can process many unique connections.
